## Encrypted filesystem

`/home/root` is encrypted using [RedTeamPentesting's project](https://github.com/RedTeamPentesting/remarkable-encryption)
in case the device is lost/stolen. Cloud Sync is enabled however, see [here](https://github.com/EricMountain/remarkable-encryption/tree/current/contrib/sync).
